# Python Eats Tail
PythonEatsTail.com explains its own creation. It contains written and video tutorials on all elements of its own creation. The goal is to show all that is needed to build and deploy an example Python site. While all tutorials are obviously related, they are as self-sustained as possible and can be read and viewed independently from each other.

## Getting Started
The software is available for cloning or download. However the goal is obviously to learn from its development, so the best way to do this is dive into the tutorials.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to provide a learning experience through the combination of four elements:
- written tutorials
- video tutorials
- the site itself
- the code

## Prerequisites
A development computer with Python and PostgreSQL. For deployment a Linux server.

## Examples
Development starts from scratch and covers at least the following:
- installing Django and Wagtail in a virtual environment
- setting up a custom user model with address, phone number, photo etc.
- setting up authentication, including email verification and social accounts
- versioning on Github and continuous integration with Travis
- multiple languages
- content management with Wagtail
- webpages with images, embedded video, code
- footer with cookie statement and privacy policy
- editable forms with ReCAPTCHA
- allowing users to comment on articles
- creating an editable navigation menu with language switch and account login
- testing with coverage and factory boy
- deployment on a Linux server with Nginx, Gunicorn and Supervisor
- backup and restore

## Built With
Python, Django, Wagtail, PostgreSQL, allauth, Nginx, Gunicorn, Supervisor and more
